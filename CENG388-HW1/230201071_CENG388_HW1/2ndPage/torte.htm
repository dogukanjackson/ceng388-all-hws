I loved the buttery taste of the crust which complements the apples very nicely.<br>&mdash; Rewieved on Sep. 22, 2010 by MMASON.

Notthing special. I like the crust, but there was a little too much of it for my taste, and I liked the filling but there was too little bit. I thought the <br>cruncy apples combined with the sliced almonds detracted from the overall flavor.<br>&mdash; Rewieved on Sep. 1, 2010 by GLENDACHEF.

Delicious!!I reccomend microwaving the apples for 3 minutes before baking, to soften them. Great dessert - I'll be making it again for the <br>holidays.<br>&mdash; Rewieved on August 28, 2010 by BBABS.
